I am a current student at Wittenberg University pursuing a bachelor's degree in Computer Science with Cybersecurity Concentration. The challenge of addressing complicated problems has always captivated me, especially in domains where creativity and critical thinking are crucial. I find cybersecurity in particular to be a dynamic and quickly changing field that necessitates a continuous balancing act between creativity and attentiveness. In this repository you will be able to locate items such as: Resume, Professional statement, Ethical Hacking Activities, and CTF activities and challenges. 

## Objective


My quest to learn as much as I can in computer science has led me to establish a love for cybersecurity, and I am now excited to transition into this field, particularly targeting a position as a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
